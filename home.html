                       Resident Evil 4 - The Story

It was supposed to be a simple rescue mission. Leon S. Kennedy, once a rookie cop who survived the Raccoon City nightmare, had become a skilled government agent. Now, in 2004, he found himself driving through the misty countryside of rural Spain with a single objective: find and rescue Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, who had been kidnapped by an unknown group.

As Leon arrived at a isolated village, something felt wrong. The locals were hostile, their eyes vacant and filled with rage. When they attacked, Leon realized these weren't ordinary villagers—they were infected by something far more sinister than the zombies he once knew. These creatures, called Ganados, were faster, smarter, and controlled by a parasitic organism called Las Plagas.

Leon fought his way through the village, uncovering the terrible truth: a cult called Los Illuminados had resurrected Las Plagas and was using it to control people. Their leader, Osmund Saddler, had a terrifying plan—infect Ashley with the parasite, send her back to her father, and use her to spread Las Plagas to world leaders, giving the cult control over nations.

Leon finally found Ashley locked in a church, but their reunion was cut short when he discovered they had both been injected with Las Plagas. Time was running out. If they didn't find a way to remove the parasites, they would lose their minds and become slaves to Saddler's will. </p>

Their escape led them through a towering castle ruled by the deranged Ramon Salazar, a castellan who served Saddler with twisted devotion. Leon battled through Salazar's grotesque experiments and traps, all while protecting Ashley and fighting the parasite growing inside him.

But the nightmare wasn't over. Beyond the castle lay a military island fortress—the cult's headquarters. Here, Leon faced armed soldiers, horrific bio-weapons, and finally, Osmund Saddler himself, now transformed into a monstrous creature by Las Plagas.

Throughout his journey, Leon encountered Ada Wong, a mysterious woman from his past. Though her motives remained unclear, she provided crucial help at key moments, suggesting she had her own agenda with the cult.

In a final desperate battle, Leon defeated Saddler and, with Ada's assistance, found a way to remove the parasites from both himself and Ashley. As the island began to self-destruct, Leon and Ashley escaped on a jet ski, watching the fortress explode behind them.

They had survived. Ashley was safe. The cult's plans had been destroyed. But Leon knew this was just another chapter in a never-ending fight against bio-terrorism. Somewhere in the shadows, new threats were already emerging, and he would be ready to face them.

The nightmare may have ended, but for Leon S. Kennedy, the fight was far from over.
